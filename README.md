# InputStream

I dont know what to do for the logo 🤔. Guess that comes a nother time

I have no clue on how to make a good README file, nor how to make a good github repo.
So if anyone has time to help me set it up, please do contact me

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
   `git clone https://github.com/nissemanen/InputStream.git` or select Code → Download ZIP → extract it
2. Prepare the environment
   ```bash
   cd InputStream
   python3 -m venv .venv`
   Linux:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   Windows:
   ```batch
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate```
3. Install packages
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run
   `python3 app.py`
