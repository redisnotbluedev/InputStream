# InputStream

I dont know what to do for the logo 🤔. Guess that comes a nother time

I have no clue on how to make a good README file, nor how to make a good github repo.
So if anyone has time to help me set it up, please do contact me

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nissemanen/InputStream.git
   ```
   or select Code → Download ZIP → extract it

2. Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment
   ```bash
   cd InputStream
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment
   
   **Linux/macOS:**
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   **Windows:**
   ```batch
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate
   ```

4. Install packages
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the application
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```
